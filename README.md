Hi! Welcome to my Frogger game, a modern take on the classic arcade game.
In this game, the player must navigate a frog through various obstacles
to reach its destination safely. You have 10 seconds to do this before you lose and the goal is to get as much points as you can before running out of time. As you progress the game gets harder and harder.
